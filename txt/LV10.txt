I have a dream today.
Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
Everybody has talent, but ability takes hard work.
Better hazard once than always be in fear.
Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.
Every day is a new day.
You always pass failure on the way to success.
A problem is your chance to do your best.
Never,never,never,never,give up.
A goal without a plan is just a wish.
It always seems impossible until it’s done.
Knowledge is power.
It’s all about the journey, not the outcome.
Stay hungry. Stay foolish.
Death is just life’s next big adventure.
There is nothing like a dream to create the future.
If you can dream it, you can do it.
The future starts today, not tomorrow.
